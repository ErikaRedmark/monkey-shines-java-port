/**
 * 
 * Provided to all game objects capable of producing sounds; provides methods to indicate to the sound manager
 * certain events have occurred and to play certain sounds. There is little customisation in this class; all
 * 'modding' comes from modifying the sounds it loads. For example, a 'yum collected' event always plays the
 * yum sound and nothing else.
