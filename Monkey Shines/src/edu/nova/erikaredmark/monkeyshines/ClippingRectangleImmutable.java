/**
 * An immutable version of the {@link ClippingRectangle} class
 * <p/>
 * This class has the advantage of re-using clipping rectangles. Instances returned by the static factories of this class
 * can and will be shared by other objects in the game if the properties of the instance request match exactly the properties
 * of another instance.
 * <p/>
 * This commonly happens with clipping rectangles for sprite sheets.
