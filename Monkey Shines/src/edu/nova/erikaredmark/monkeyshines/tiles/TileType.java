 * Interface for indicating classes operate as a 'tile' in the game world. Some tile types are stateless; these
 * are implemented as enumerations. Other types may carry with them some intrinsic state, that is either supplied on
 * creation and never changed or can be changed during course of gameplay.
 * <p/>
 * This is intended mostly as a marker interface, but a few helpful methods for editors may be added.
