# What is Monkey Shines?
*Monkey Shines* was a game published by Fantasoft in 1997, and the game is now abandonware. The purpose of this project is merely to rebuild the game for Java so it is cross-platform and does not require emulation to
run properly. It is not intended to look 100% graphically identical in all menus (the editor in particular can use some good advancements over the original). This is mostly a project for personal benefit.

# Why?
Having heavy nostalgia for a game I can not run even in a emulator, I decided to take up as a challenge to see if I can re-create the game in a form that will be more accessible and still function mostly identical. I consider
working on this a hobby. Since there is no reason to keep the code to myself I decided there is no harm in hosting it on github.
